## Background

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this repository we will use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Using knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, we will use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, we will use the original dataset. Second, we will resample the data by using the `RandomOverSampler` module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, we'll get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
